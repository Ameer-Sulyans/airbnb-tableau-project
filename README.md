# Airbnb Tableau Analysis

This repository contains my Tableau project analyzing Airbnb data.  
I originally planned to upload the project to Tableau Public, but the file size was too large.  
Because of that, I decided to share it here on GitHub instead.

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on Airbnb listings and visualizes the relationship between price, bedrooms, and location.  

The Tableau workbook includes:
- 📊 **Average Price per Bedroom (Bar Chart)**
- 🗺️ **Average Price by Zip Code (Map Visualization)**
- 📉 **Bar Graph of Average Price by Zip Code**

## File
- `Tableau Project - AirBnB- Ameer Sulyans.twb` → Tableau workbook file

## How to Open
1. Download the `.twb` file.
2. Open it using **Tableau Desktop** (or Tableau Reader).
3. Explore the dashboards and worksheets.
